# 1. Overview of Tasks 

The objectives of this assignment were: 
• Task 1: Create a new Pluggable Database (PDB) named ce_pdb_28228 and a user 
Cedric_plsqlauca_28228 to store all class work. 
• Task 2: Create and then delete another PDB named ce_to_delete_pdb_28228 to 
practice PDB deletion. 
• Task 3: Configure Oracle Enterprise Manager (OEM) and verify the PDBs visually.

## TASK1: create new pluggable database ( pdb  ) 
I used cmd to connect to my Oracle database using SQL*Plus. After connecting, I began Task 
1 by creating a pluggable database named ce_pdb_28228. The admin user I created for this 
PDB is Cedric_plsqlauca_28228, following the specified format.
